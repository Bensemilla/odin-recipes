        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish is a northern german classic and specialty. Also lovingly called "Moppelkotze" in the local tongue it doesnt necessarily look like something one would eat but certainly already stepped into on the way home after a long alcohol infused night. Although it is not the most visually pleasing dish its heartiness and rich flavour makes it a favourite of many a northern german person.</p>
