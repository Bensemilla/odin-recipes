# odin-recipes

This project test and puts in practice the knowledge that has been acquired so far, working through the Odin basics training.

The goal of this project is to build a website with links to different recipes.

By completing this project i will show that i understood and am able to put into practice all i have learned so far i.e.:
- write the basic structure of an html file
- use ordered and unordered lists
- use links
- create a github repository and get in the habit of adding, committing and pushing my code regularly to create a timeline of the changes to the files
